## Formatting & Some Mechanics

- Add empty lines around headings, parapraphs, lists, etc., except for the very start of the file.
- Lists:
    - For unordered lists, use `-`, not `*`.
    - For ordered lists, use `1.`, never `2.` etc.
    - Lines directly following a list item, indented or not, are interpreted as continuations of the previous line (mechanic).
    - Indented lines following a list item with a new-line in-between are interpreted as new lines within the item (mechanic).
    - Indent with four spaces.
