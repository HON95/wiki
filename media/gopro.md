## GoPro HERO5 Black

- The phone app is really useful for display preview, control, settings etc.
- Supports clean HDMI out:
    - Go to the settings (pull down) and set "HDMI output" to "live".
    - The back display turns off.
    - The FOV is really wide and it doesn't support dark environments too well.

## GoPro HERO10 Black

- Needs the Media Mod (physical frame with mic, connectors and accessory rail) for HDMI output. This started with HERO8.
- Can not record with both the battery inserted and a charger connected (impractical for e.g. timelapses).
- Requires a proper phone charger, if not it will simply refuse to charge/stay on.
- The phone app is really useful for display preview, control, settings etc.
- Supports clean HDMI out:
    - Must use the Media Mod for the actual HDMI port.
    - The back display turns off.
    - The FOV is really wide and it doesn't support dark environments too well.
    - Other recommended settings:
        - Video mode: Highest Quality (for more appropriate resolutions etc.)
        - Resolution/etc.: Doesn't actually matter for live output.
        - Lens/FOV: Whatever fits, but narrower means digital zoom and reduced quality.
        - HyperSmooth: Standard or off
        - White balance: Auto
        - Color: Natural
        - Media mod: Front (capture audio in front, using media mod mic)
    - When connecting HDMI (without Labs):
        - It starts in the gallery meny, press mode two times and capture once to exit.
        - To hide the HUD, press mode four (ish) times to mark the blind eye, then capture to select it.
    - Labs variant:
        - Go to [gopro.com/labs](gopro.com/labs) and follow the instructions for how to install the Labs firmware on the camera.
        - If the app asks to upgrade the firmware, don't. It will overwrite the Labs firmware with the normal firmware.
    - **TODO** Clean output?
