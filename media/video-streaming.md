## General

- Resources:
    - [Webcam setup (ArchWiki)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Webcam_setup)

## Hardware

- Some webcams come with H264 hardware encoders. Notably, Logitech's C920/C922 had a H264 hardware encoder in earlier versions but then removed it.
- Webcams may use a lot of data, so try to avoid congestion points like USB hubs.
