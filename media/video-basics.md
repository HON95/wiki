- Video formats:
    - **TODO**
    - MP4 (aka MPEG-4 Part 14):
        - A container format (using other formats internally like e.g. H.264 for the video part).
    - H.264 (aka AVC):
        - Aka Advanced Video Coding (AVC) or MPEG-4 Part 10.
        - One of the most commonly used, implemented in many products.
    - H.265 (aka HEVC):
        - Aka High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC).
        - The successor to H.264/AVC and better in most ways, but not as popular yet.
