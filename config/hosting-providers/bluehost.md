## Experience

- I spent _a lot_ of time communicating with tech support regarding stuff on their end that should be working but was not. The problems were rarely resolved.
- As an example, one of the SSL certs which was set to auto renew in their control panel expired, leaving the site with an expired SSL certificate for multiple days.
