### Using
{:.no_toc}

- DL380p Gen8

## Firmware Updates

**TODO**

## Management

- The default iLO username (typically `Administrator`) and password can be found on the service tag pull-out.
- For added security, add a personal user and delete the default admin user.

## Storage

- Gen8 requires genuine HP drives and caddies for Gen8 to work properly. When using unsupported drives, the server will be super noisy. HP drives generally are both more expensive and have less performance than the alternatives, making it a a potentially unattractive option for homelabs. This may be somewhat true for previous gens as well (I don't know, I don't have any), but Gen8 is especially restrictive.
