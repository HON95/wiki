## Setup (Debian)

1. Add Kubic repo (pre Debian 11âˆ•Ubuntu 20.10 only):
    1. Install dependencies: `apt install curl wget gnupg2`
    1. Get OS info: `source /etc/os-release`
    1. Add repo: `echo "deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/xUbuntu_${VERSION_ID}/ /" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubic-libcontainers.list`
    1. Add GPG key (old way): `wget -nv https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable/xUbuntu_${VERSION_ID}/Release.key -O- | apt-key add -`
1. Install: `apt install podman`
1. Verify install: `podman info`
1. (Optional) Add Docker alias: `ln -s /usr/bin/podman /usr/bin/docker`

### Docker Compose

**TODO**

## Usage

### General

- See [Docker usage](../docker/#usage).
    - Most commands are Docker clones and simply replacing `docker` with `podman` in the command will typically work.
    - Configuration files are a bit different.

### Networking

- IPv6:
    - Doesn't seem to be as broken/neglected as in Docker.
    - Add `--ipv6 --subnet=<subnet>/64` to enable on bridges (with NAT and firewalling, like IPv4).
